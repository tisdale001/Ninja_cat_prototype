My Tileset Package by Kimpo.

1. There are 8 different tilesets (4 grass and 4 dirt which have their own .png file(s)).
2. There are also 8 different platforms to mathch above tilesets, which also have .png file(s) and the aseprite file for the animation(s).
3. You can import the Tileset png's into your game and set them up to be 32x32 for each tile. This enables you to use the tileset for your game.
4. You can also import the platforms into your game.
4. For importing platforms, the _(number) at the end of the file is the amount of frames per file. I use GameMaker and importing into this engine, it knows that the file will be 10 frames if it has a _10 on the end.

Otherwise, have a great time using my tilesets. :)
